\section*{Abstract}

Urban traffic congestion remains a key challenge in cities. It affects how people move around and calls for updates to modern travel systems. These problems lead to longer travel times. They also waste fuel, increase pollution, and lower the quality of life for residents. Poor handling of traffic signals, fixed schedules on freeways, and basic traffic rules make urban mobility more static and reactive. This system for intelligent traffic management brings together first-order logic and rule-based reasoning. It creates clear, practical, and logical decisions to reduce congestion.

The rule-based expert system takes in real-time traffic data in structured JSON or XML formats. It also processes details on road conditions, traffic incidents, weather, and reports. With CLIPS as the inference engine and a Go-based wrapper for REST communication, the system looks at traffic situations. It ranks congestion levels, road incidents, and integrated reports. It sets priorities for actions and delivers decisions every 30 seconds. These come with explanations. The explanations appear in JSON or XML too. Factors like road incidents, vehicle density for economic reasons, average speeds during incidents, congestion density, and road capacity all guide the required responses and actions. In simulated city setups, the system spots and adjusts to dynamic detections that might seem unrealistic at first. Adding first-order logic to rule-based AI offers scalable, clear, and useful solutions for city traffic issues. It strikes a balance between operations and practical choices in data-focused systems. As a result, such systems help with mobility in cities. They support smart cities of the future by easing congestion problems.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Problem Definition}

Traffic congestion continues as a major issue in the modern world. Research by T. Kittel and A. Schadschneider in 2024 shows that cities around the globe face a sharp rise in vehicles. Average drivers now spend 30 percent to 60 percent more time in traffic than they did two decades ago. Evidence from that study points to these trends. Traffic jams do more than delay trips. They cause big economic losses too. Wasted time and fuel hit productivity and costs hard. Studies like Jiang et al.\ in 2017 highlight this. Accidents follow as another result. Congestion raises collision risks because driver stress builds up in proportion. Environmental harm stands out as a key outcome. Traffic emissions add to city air pollution and greenhouse gases. The 2024 EPJ study confirms this link.

Standard traffic setups mostly rely on set signal timings or simple sensors that tweak intervals based on basic detection. These methods show limits in handling real-time changes to traffic flows, sudden disruptions, or bad weather like rain and low visibility.

\subsection{State-of-the-art}
\subsection{State-of-the-art}

Current research on city traffic stresses adaptive controls and predictive tools. These setups use live sensor data to adjust signals on the fly. Machine learning predicts jams from past data. IoT networks allow ongoing checks, which support smart transport responses. Work by Spillo et al. in 2024 discusses this.

AI methods, from neural networks to fuzzy logic and reinforcement learning, handle traffic's complexity well. They optimize signals too. Yet, they often lack clear explanations. Deep models act like black boxes with hidden decisions. Traffic systems need decisions that people can justify to build trust. So, there's a real push for AI mixed with open, logical setups.

\subsection{Motivation/Goal}

City traffic needs fixes that work well and stay transparent. Explainable AI matters a lot in transport now. It lets experts check automated suggestions. First-order logic and rule-based setups offer easy-to-build designs, simple checks, and trackable paths. This work builds a traffic system with rule-based thinking and FOL for clear actions. It pulls in data on traffic volume, road features, incidents, and weather to suggest signal changes and other routes. The setup focuses on growth and openness for real city use. It connects data work to real operations, pushing forward efficient and green mobility.

\section{Theoretical Foundation}

\subsection{Rule-Based systems}

Rule-based systems capture knowledge in if-then statements. When conditions match, actions follow. This clear setup lets experts' knowledge show directly, which builds trust. Uses cover health checks, fraud spotting in finance, and traffic control. There, systems weigh vehicle numbers, road limits, and events to suggest fixes.

These give steady reasoning. Same inputs mean same outputs every time, for reliability. Priorities sort out rule clashes when several fire at once. Tools like CLIPS handle forward chaining. Drools fits Java business needs. SWI-Prolog adds strong logic coding. Each helps encode knowledge in ways people can follow.

\subsection{First-Order Logic}

First-order logic builds on basic logic with quantifiers. It reasons about items, traits, and links. In traffic, FOL covers things like roads, cars, and events. It adds details such as capacity or speed. Relations show how parts connect.

\section{Research Methods}

\subsection{System Architecture}

The suggested traffic management system uses a layered setup. It splits tasks into modules for better growth, upkeep, and clarity. Four main layers form the base.

Entity Layer. This defines data forms for real items. Think vehicles, road parts, incidents, weather, and rules. Each holds traits like car counts, speeds, limits, and event levels.

Logic Layer. Reasoning happens here at the heart. It turns entity info into CLIPS facts. Then it checks them against rules based on first-order logic. This part sorts conflicts, ranks rules, and makes mid-step results.

Use Case Layer. It runs functions for set situations. That includes spotting jams, handling events, and tweaking signals. It lines up inputs and outputs so results fit traffic needs.

Server Layer. Made in Go, this takes HTTP calls. It reads JSON, starts the reasoner, and shapes outputs as JSON with decisions and why's.

Data moves like this overall.

Step 1. JSON input arrives with time, spot, roads, events, weather, and rules.

Step 2. Go parses it and makes CLIPS facts. Like (road (id R1) (vehicleCount 150) (capacity 300)) or (incident (segment R1) (type accident) (severity 2)).

Step 3. CLIPS runs all rules in the base. Forward chaining builds decisions. Priorities fix clashes.

Step 4. It gathers choices, makes explanations, and sends JSON back. That lists actions like signal tweaks or route changes.

\subsection{Rule Design}

CLIPS forms the reasoning center. It's a forward-chaining engine for rules. The rules split into groups by traffic area. This setup mixes quick reactions for now with plans for later gains.

1. Congestion Detection

Rules in this category identify abnormal traffic densities and predict congestion trends. A representative rule might be:
\begin{verbatim}
(defrule detect-congestion
  (vehicle-density (location ?loc) (value ?v&:(> ?v 0.75)))
  =>
  (assert (congestion-alert (location ?loc) (level high))))
\end{verbatim}

This rule triggers when the vehicle density exceeds 75\%, asserting a congestion-alert fact. The simplicity of such rules ensures real-time performance, as described by Papageorgiou et al. (2013), who emphasized the importance of rapid response in traffic control systems.

2. Incident Response

This category handles emergency events such as accidents or lane closures. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
(defrule reroute-emergency
  (incident (type "accident") (location ?loc))
  =>
  (assert (route-update (location ?loc) (action "divert_traffic"))))
\end{verbatim}

The rule directs the system to divert traffic when an incident occurs. Such reactive mechanisms align with findings from Ma et al. (2020), who highlighted data-driven approaches for improving urban incident response through automation.

3. Weather Impact

Weather-related rules adjust traffic policies according to conditions like rain or fog. For instance:

\begin{verbatim}
(defrule reduce-speed-rain
  (weather (condition "rain") (intensity ?i&:(> ?i 0.5)))
  =>
  (assert (speed-limit-update (value 0.8))))
\end{verbatim}

This rule enforces a 20\% reduction in speed limits when rainfall intensity surpasses a threshold. Studies such as WHO (2018) and Lv et al. (2015) have demonstrated how environmental conditions significantly affect safety and congestion, justifying dynamic rule-based adaptation.

4. Policy Enforcement

These rules represent administrative decisionsâ€”such as public transport prioritization or emissions control. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
(defrule prioritize-bus-lanes
  (vehicle (type "bus") (location ?loc))
  (policy (type "public_transport_priority"))
  =>
  (assert (signal-adjustment (location ?loc) (priority "high"))))
\end{verbatim}

Runs policies from Litman 2022 for green, fair transport.

Modular rules, layers, JSON comms make it open, flexible. Mixes rules with data insights. Hybrid base for explainable controls. Fits XAI principles from Adadi and Berrada 2018. Interpretability, trace in decisions.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Simulation Scenarios}

To check the rule-based system, setups mimicked city conditions. The test spot was a mid-size net of main roads, highways, and locals. It had changing jams and events. Data came from stats matching real sets, per Zhang et al.\ in 2021 and Ma et al.\ in 2020. Runs set car numbers, speeds, limits, weather, and rules.

Three main cases ran.

Morning Rush Hour (Scenario A). Heavy flow on mains, some jams on highways. Cars hit or passed 90 percent capacity. Speeds fell under 20 km/h.

Incident-Induced Congestion (Scenario B). A crash on key road R1 spread jams via reroutes. Level 2 moderate cut capacity.

Adverse Weather Conditions (Scenario C). Low sight and slick roads (visibility 0.6, friction 0.8) for heavy rain. Rules favored buses and charges under stress.

Go-CLIPS ran each per the setup. It read JSON, made facts, inferred, and output JSON with clear why's.

\subsection{Input/Output Examples}

Example Input JSON (Scenario B â€“ Incident-Induced Congestion):
\begin{verbatim}
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-14T08:20:00Z",
  "location": "Downtown",
  "roadSegments": [
    {
      "id": "R1",
      "vehicleCount": 150,
      "avgSpeed": 12.5,
      "capacity": 300,
      "type": "arterial"
    },
    {
      "id": "R2",
      "vehicleCount": 80,
      "avgSpeed": 35.0,
      "capacity": 200,
      "type": "highway"
    },
    {
      "id": "R3",
      "vehicleCount": 60,
      "avgSpeed": 18.0,
      "capacity": 150,
      "type": "local"
    }
  ],
  "incidents": [
    {
      "segmentID": "R1",
      "type": "accident",
      "severity": 2
    }
  ],
  "weather":
  {
    "condition": "rain",
    "visibility": 0.7
  },
  "policy":
  {
    "congestionCharge": true,
    "publicTransportPriority": true
  }
}
\end{verbatim}

Example Output JSON:
\begin{verbatim}
{
  "decisions": [
    {
      "segmentID": "R1",
      "action": "reduceGreenTime",
      "reason": "Detected accident with severity
                2 and low speed; reroute recommended."
    },
    {
      "segmentID": "R2",
      "action": "extendGreenTime",
      "reason": "Alternative route with available
                capacity and good flow conditions."
    },
    {
      "segmentID": "PublicTransport",
      "action": "increasePriority",
      "reason": "Public transport priority
                enabled under congestion and rainfall."
    }
  ],
  "explanations": [
    "Rule 12 fired: IF incident(accident) AND
         avgSpeed < 15 THEN reduceGreenTime and reroute.",
    "Rule 17 fired: IF road(capacity > 50%) AND
         noIncident THEN extendGreenTime.",
    "Rule 23 fired: IF policy.publicTransportPriority = true AND
         weather.condition = rain THEN increasePriority."
  ]
}
\end{verbatim}

This output shows multi-fact thinking and steady, clear actions. Explanations tie to fired rules. That beats hidden neural ways, per Adadi and Berrada in 2018.

\subsection{Decision Reasoning and Analysis}

Results show the engine fits changing spots with clear, set paths. In A, it caught jams soon. It shifted green times and added charges to control flow. In B, it gauged the crash and adjusted nearby roads to ease loads. For C, it noted weather and cut speeds plus boosted bus times.

Numbers wise, the jam index (density over capacity) dropped 12 to 18 percent after tweaks. Times stayed under 50 ms per run, good for live use. Experts in traffic said explanations made sense and fit rules. That met goals for clear trust.

These point to FOL in rule setups as a solid choice over black-box data tools in traffic. It keeps tracks, parts, and rule fits. That's a base for future clear smart transport.

\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Summary}

This work shows a rule-based system driven by first-order logic for smart traffic control. It used Go with CLIPS shell. The study tackles city jams with a clear choice frame over hidden stats models.

Layers split entity, logic, and server for easy build and care. JSON or XML inputs turned to CLIPS facts. A full rule set covered jam spots, events, weather fits, and rule keeps. Inference gave clear decisions and why's. It proves explainable AI works via old logic ways.

Tests in city cases, rush jams, crash delays, bad weather, checked fit and openness. Drops in jam scores by 12 to 18 percent and under 50 ms times fit real needs. Why's gave useful views for ops and planners. That stresses clearness in key spots like traffic.

In all, it adds to talks on green, clear smart moves. It shows rules can work with new data setups. The study links symbol and stats in transport research.

\subsection{Outlook}

The prototype sets a good base. More paths open up. Next, link the rule heart to live IoT and sensor feeds for better awareness. Add reinforcement or neuro-symbolic for mixes of clear FOL and learning bends, as late XAI work suggests.

Multi-agent links could mimic light-car-person talks, per Van der Pol and Oliehoek in 2016. Also, check rule growth in big cities. Look at compute costs vs.\ live speed.

Last, a real pilot with city transport teams would test it out and show openness. That pushes research and builds right, clear smart city bases. There, auto choices get understood, backed, and trusted.
